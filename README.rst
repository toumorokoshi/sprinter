Installation
------------

It's recommended to use Sprinter's standalone installer:

OSX::

    $ curl -s https://raw.github.com/toumorokoshi/sprinter/master/scripts/sandbox.sh > /tmp/sprinter; bash /tmp/sprinter

Debian-Based (e.g. Ubuntu)::
    
    $ cd /tmp/; rm sandbox.sh; wget https://raw.github.com/toumorokoshi/sprinter/master/scripts/sandbox.sh -O sandbox.sh; bash sandbox.sh
   

You can also install sprinter using easy_install or pip (not recommended, it's easier to update with the standalone)::

    $ (sudo) easy_install http://github.com/toumorokoshi/sprinter/tarball/master

    $ (sudo) pip install http://github.com/toumorokoshi/sprinter/tarball/master

What is it?
-----------

A cross-platform environment bootstrapping framework!

Sprinter is a framework designed to making bootstrapping development
environments easier. There are three main components to a usable
sprinter environment:

* This python egg, to fully utilize the framework
* a sprinter.cfg file, which contains the configuration necessary to install features
* sprinter formulas, which each feature uses as it's instruction manual on how to setup, update, and remove itself 

Read more about Sprinter on the `docs <http://sprinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
